## 📜 Open Letter to Overextended, CommunityOX, and the FiveM Community

First of all, let’s be honest: the work done by **Overextended** and **CommunityOX** has raised the bar in FiveM development. Your resources are impressive, your code is sharp, and there's no doubt you’re some of the most talented developers in this space.

That said — and we say this with respect — talent doesn’t excuse toxicity.

Lately, the way some of the leadership in these groups has handled community interactions has created a negative atmosphere. There's been gatekeeping, passive aggression, and a general vibe of “us vs them” that’s making FiveM feel smaller and more divided than it should be.

We also understand the frustration that comes from seeing your work used without proper respect for the **GPL-3.0** license. That kind of misuse is wrong and unfair — no question about it. But those situations should be addressed through the right channels, with clarity and professionalism, not through public hostility or exclusion.

What’s even more concerning is the way some Discord groups tied to these communities are being used almost like echo chambers — where negativity, personal attacks, and hostile behavior towards others are encouraged, even normalized. Turning followers into a tool for spreading resentment doesn’t help protect your work — it just spreads more harm.

This platform was never meant to be controlled by one mindset or one circle. It thrives because people are free to build, share, and explore different ideas without fear of being dismissed or talked down to. When a few voices try to dominate or exclude others, the whole community suffers.

We’re not here to cancel anyone. This isn’t an attack. It’s a reminder that being a good developer is only part of the picture — how we treat people matters just as much.

FiveM deserves to be a place where people can collaborate, not compete for status. Where knowledge is shared, not hoarded. And where differences spark conversation, not conflict.

So here’s the ask: take a step back. Let’s shift the tone. Let’s make FiveM about creating, learning, and growing — together.

**There’s enough room here for everyone.**

**Let’s make this community better, not smaller.**
